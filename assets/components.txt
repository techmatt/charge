Amplifier	2	0	A	no	no	Amplifier	Accepts two charges and emits a charge that is one level higher than the larger of the receieved charges.
FilteredAmplifier	3	0	L	yes	no	# Amplifier	Accept two charges and emits a # charge.  Will not accept a second charge unless the sum is strong enough to produce a # charge.
TeleportSource	4	0	T	yes	no	# Transmitter	Teleports a charge to the closest # receiver.
TeleportDestination	5	0	R	yes	no	# Receiver	Accepts charges from # transmitters.  Otherwise behave like a normal wire.
ChargeFilter	6	0	F	yes	no	# Filter	Only allows # charge to pass through.
Hold	5	1	H	no	no	Hold	Holds will accept a charge and keep it until the charge has a valid destination to move towards.
GateOpen	-1	-1	!	yes	yes	# Gate (Open)	"Gates don't allow charge to pass when closed, but behave like wires when open.  # gates are controlled by a # switch."
