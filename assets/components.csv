Wire,0,0,W,no,no,Wire,Allows charge to flow.
Splitter,1,0,S,no,no,Splitter,Splits a large charge into multiple smaller charges.|Red -> Red|Orange -> 2 Red|Yellow -> 3 Red|Green ->  2 Orange|Blue -> 2 Yellow
Amplifier,2,0,A,no,no,Amplifier,Amplifiers accept two charges and emit a charge that is one level higher than the larger of the receieved charges.
FilteredAmplifier,3,0,L,yes,no,Colored Amplifier,Colored Amlifiers accept two charges and emit a charge of its color.  It will not accept a second charge that is not strong enough to produce the emitted color.
TeleportSource,4,0,T,yes,no,Transmitter,"Transmitters will teleport a charge to the closest receiver of the same channel.  The possible channels are Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Blue."
TeleportDestination,5,0,R,yes,no,Receiver,"Receivers will accept charges from transmitters of the same channel, and otherwise behave like a normal wire."
ChargeFilter,6,0,F,yes,no,Filter,Filters only allow charges of their color to pass through.
Hold,5,1,H,no,no,Hold,Holds will accept a charge and keep it until the charge has a valid destination to move towards.
GateOpen,-1,-1,G,yes,yes,Gate (Open),"Gates don't allow charge to pass when closed, but behave like wires when open.  Colored gates are controlled by the switch of the same color."
GateClosed,0,1,!,yes,yes,Gate (Closed),"Gates don't allow charge to pass when closed, but behave like wires when open.  Colored gates are controlled by the switch of the same color."
GateSwitch,1,1,B,yes,yes,Gate Switch,A colored switch will toggle all gates of the same color.
Circuit,4,1,X,no,no,Chip,"Chips allow you to build a 5x5 grid worth of components into a single space. They can be flipped and rotated, as well as copied (c) and pasted (v)."
TrapOpen,2,1,T,yes,yes,Trap (Open),"A trap behaves like a normal wire for the first charge that passes through it, then it will close. |Traps can be reset by cranks."
TrapSprung,-1,-1,!,yes,yes,Trap (Closed),"A trap behaves like a normal wire for the first charge that passes through it, then it will close. |Traps can be reset by cranks."
TrapReset,3,1,E,yes,yes,Crank,A colored crank will open all traps of the same color.  A gray crank will only open the nearest trap.
PowerSource,6,1,P,yes,no,Generator,Produce charge and send it to adjacent components.
MegaHold,4,2,!,yes,yes,Goal Battery,"Goals need to be filled with a charge of the same color.  Once all goals are filled correctly, you win!"
ChargeGoal,5,2,!,yes,no,Goal,"Goals need to be filled with a charge of the same color.  Once all goals are filled correctly, you win!"
Blocker,6,2,!,no,no,Blocker,Blockers never allow charge to pass through them.
WireMajorAccelerator,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Wire - Major Accelerator @|Upgrading to a Major Accelerator causes all charges to pass through this Wire very quickly.
WireMinorAccelerator,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Wire - Minor Accelerator @|Upgrading to a Minor Accelerator causes all charges to pass through this Wire quickly.
WireMinorDelay,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Wire - Minor Delay @|Upgrading to a Minor Delay causes all charges to pass through this Wire slowly.
WireMajorDelay,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Wire - Major Delay @|Upgrading to a Major Delay causes all charges to pass through this Wire very slowly.
CircuitBoundary,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,"Wire @|Wires are used to direct charge in any direction. Charge will move from a Wire to any available adjacent component, preferring components that have least recently received a charge."
CircuitPaste,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Pastes the copied chip.
CircuitRotate90,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Rotates the selected chip 90 degrees clockwise.
CircuitRotateN90,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Rotates the selected chip 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
CircuitFlipHorizontal,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Flips the selected chip horizontally.
CircuitFlipVertical,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Flips the selected chip vertically.
CircuitCopy,-1,-1,!,no,no,Invalid,Copy the selected chip by presscing (C). Paste by pressing (V).
GateClosedGrayProxy,0,2,!,no,no,Gray Gate,"Gate (Open) - Red @|Gates don't allow charge to pass when closed, but behave like Wires when open. Red Gates are controlled by any Red Switch."
GateSwitchGrayProxy,1,2,!,no,no,Gray Button,Switch - Red @|A Red Switch will toggle all Red Doors. It behaves like a normal Wire for the charge.
TrapOpenGrayProxy,2,2,!,no,no,Gray Trap (Open),"Trap (Open) @|A Trap behaves like a normal Wire for the first charge that passes through it, then it will close."
TrapResetGrayProxy,3,2,!,no,no,Gray Crank,Crank - Gray @|A Gray Crank will open the nearest Gray Trap. It behaves like a normal Wire for the charge.
