Features to implement

SPLASH SCREEN
 * Play!
 * Level editor (different background etc. to make it very clear?)
 * Play mode has an exit to the splash screen, that then connects back to the level editor, to avoid people getting confused about what mode they are in.

GAME UI
 * level editor

CHANGES
 * ability to copy between levels for both components and circuits

CHANGES: GAME UI
 * Ability to save/load multiple solutions for puzzles
 * visual indicators for component state:
    * recency of receiving charge
    * direction that next charge will go (?)
	* charges left in power sources

CHANGES: GAME PUZZLES
 * better puzzle tutorial
 * Addition of a puzzle that relies on rotation non-invariance
 * a puzzle where you can only build goal-holds instead of wires
 * a puzzle where there are several built-in loops, like a wire running over a button. these interfere massively with the player's stuff, and the player has to exactly cancel out these button/crank presses.
 * final destination, but with one mega-hold circuit for each color. doing different colors makes it a bit harder.
 * a teleporter only level, no wires

Multi-user "start new game" in splash screen
