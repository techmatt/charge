Features to implement

GAME MODEL
 * components
    * splitter
    * amplifier
    * teleporter
    * ...
 * circuits
 * puzzle reset
 * level/save layout file


GAME UI
 * puzzle speed control
 * sound
 * level editor
 * splash screen
 * level selection
 * blocker / boundary rendering
 * load old-style puzzles


CHANGES
 * Multi-select, modification of shared properties
 * Copying and pasting arbitrary elements
 * Multi-copy, rotation of multi-copied elements
 * ability to copy between levels for both components and circuits
 * make choice of teleport consistent when ambiguous
 * fixes for charge movement in certain edge cases:
    * charges should no longer pass through each other
    * fix collision errors when charges cross wires with different speeds.

CHANGES: GAME UI
 * Ability to save/load multiple solutions for puzzles
 * visual indicators for component state:
    * recency of receiving charge
    * direction that next charge will go (?)
	* charges left in power sources

CHANGES: GAME PUZZLES
 * better puzzle tutorial
 * Addition of a puzzle that relies on rotation non-invariance
 * Creation of flavor-text for all puzzles

Questions
  * Should we allow building any desired type on the circuit boundary?
