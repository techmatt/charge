Features to implement

SPLASH SCREEN
 * Play!
 * Level editor (different background etc. to make it very clear?)
 * Play mode has an exit to the splash screen, that then connects back to the level editor, to avoid people getting confused about what mode they are in.
 * "puzzle solved" screen can have the option to save an additional solution (1st solution saved by default.)

PLAY MODE
 * select level (or go to relative level)
 * load saved progress (last save, regardless of whether it was a good solution)
 * load most recent user-solution
 * load other user-solutions
 * load provided solution(s)

KNOWN BUGS
 * charges can still sometimes pass through major delay wires in opposite directions

GAME MODEL
 * mega-circuit-holds

GAME UI
 * puzzle speed control
 * sound
 * level editor
 * splash screen
 * level selection
 * blocker / boundary rendering
 * load old-style puzzles

CHANGES
 * Multi-select, modification of shared properties
 * Copying and pasting arbitrary elements
 * Multi-copy, rotation of multi-copied elements
 * ability to copy between levels for both components and circuits
 * make choice of teleport consistent when ambiguous
 * fixes for charge movement in certain edge cases:
    * charges should no longer pass through each other
    * fix collision errors when charges cross wires with different speeds.

CHANGES: GAME UI
 * Ability to save/load multiple solutions for puzzles
 * visual indicators for component state:
    * recency of receiving charge
    * direction that next charge will go (?)
	* charges left in power sources

CHANGES: GAME PUZZLES
 * better puzzle tutorial
 * Addition of a puzzle that relies on rotation non-invariance
 * Creation of flavor-text for all puzzles
 * a puzzle where you can only build goal-holds instead of wires

Super-amplifiers -> allow production beyond 5 charge? perhaps a more interesting concept than a mega-hold (which is really just a "rate check".)
Puzzles with implicit timers, where the goal is to produce a "mega charge" before the implicit timer kills some victory condition.
